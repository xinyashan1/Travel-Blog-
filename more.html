                <h3>Voyage à paris</h3>
               <p>In this Voyage à paris travel blog I have decided to record some of the highlights about why visiting Paris 
                   is amazing! To start off there is so many things to see and there are certian customs that really stand out in this 
                city that they don't have. For example did you know that in paris that there is a certian coffee custom that they follow. Yes just 
            like all the other cultures there is coffee culture. </p>


                <P>To explain what their coffee culture is like they do have a certian way of doing things. For example there are certian hot drinks that 
                    they seem to enjoy more. The most basic one is Cafe which translates to the meaning coffee.
                </P> 
                <p>Aside from coffee culture there are also other things that really make Paris the sought out place to visit. In Paris there is something that is 
                    known as La tour Eiffel which of course is one of the most famous tourist sites. On top of that there is a paranormic view of Paris which of course 
                    is breathtaking. In other words it really is almost impossible to go to Paris and not even consider going there</p>
