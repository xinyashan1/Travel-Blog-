                <h3>Voyage à paris</h3>  


<div> 


               <p>In this Voyage à paris travel blog I have decided to record some of the highlights about why visiting Paris 
                   is amazing! To start off there is so many things to see and there are certian customs that really stand out in this 
                city that they don't have. I think that when it comes to France it is almost impossible to explore everywhere simply because 
            there is so much things to do. Yes paris and the other cities is a city that really pops out and due to that there is a reason as 
        to why that this makes it the most sought out city to travel. Although I have never been to France I have taken French because I thought 
    it would be a fun langauge to take. In addition I really do enjoy learning langauges in general because it is really interesting learning imore 
about other cultures and how it works in their world.</p> 
<p>Although there are also some culture ettiques that need to be learned here as well for example there are certian customs in France that other people might 
    not really understand however it is just apart of the cultural norm. 
</p>  


<p>It's time to triple check everything on your list once again because traveling requires not only a lot of careful timing but it would be a mishap if you 
    forget even just your ID. In any case there are several things here that you shouldn't forget and it is the following: Flight deals, Paris pass and travel insurance. Although that 
    is just the very basics I think it is important to realize that there are over 60+ tourist attraction sites so careful planning is also important. For example if you stay there 
    for about two weeks chances are if you don't have family/friends there you can easily go off and explore more than enough. However on the other hand if you're visitig family there then 
    it is safe to say they will know the best places to take look at. Yes I have never really been to France I have heard many wonderful things about it and it defiantly makes me want to go there even more. I think that in my opinion the reason why France 
    is really popular for knowing as the city of fashion is because of its exotic shopping lifestye. In addition it is also a very unique place where it has its own symbolisms that really highlights 
    its culture in a unique way.
